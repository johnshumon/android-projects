#### Remove directory from remote repository after adding them to .gitignore.
===========================================================================
The rules in your .gitignore file only apply to untracked files. Since the files under that directory were already committed in your repository, you have to unstage them, create a commit, and push that to GitHub:

git rm -r --cached some-directory

git commit -m 'Remove the now ignored directory "some-directory"'

git push origin master
